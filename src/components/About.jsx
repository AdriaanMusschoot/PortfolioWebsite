            Hi, I am Adriaan. I am currently doing my 3rd year of Game Development at Digital Arts and Entertainment - Howest Belgium. 
            On the table for the 3rd year is a semester long of working on a project together as a team and a graduation work.
            I am currently looking for an end of term internship.
            <br></br>
            My passion for games started with mobile games such as Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. When I got my first laptop it turned to competitive titles such as Rocket League.
