                    <p>
                        As final part to my education I completed an internship at Black Forest Games.
                        They are a German Company located in Offenburg. 
                        Mostly known for titles such as "Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams", "Fade to Silence", "Destroy All Humans 1 & 2". 
                        During my time there I joined the team to release an upcoming title.
                        My main task was creating a Perception System.
                        It started as a separate task so I could learn the basics of Mass in Unreal Engine, and later evolved into a core system for the designers to adopt.
                        I also worked together with the team on the trigger device system and improved the chain reaction system.
                        I will dive a bit deeper into my work for each of these systems below.
