        As a passionate game developer who thrives in team environments, I love to help other people.
        I have a keen eye for detail and like working neatly, keeping everything organized and refactoring when needed to keep everything clean.
        When I encounter problems, I can really grit my teeth and persist until I find an effective and elegant solution.

          I am currently looking for an end of study internship (february - june 2025) as a gameplay developer programming in C++.
