          As a passionate game developer who thrives in team environments, I love to help other people.
          I have a keen eye for detail and like working in a well-structured environment and approach. 
          When I encounter problems I can really grit my teeth and persist until I find an effective solution.

          I am currently looking for an end of study internship as a gameplay developer programming in C++.
